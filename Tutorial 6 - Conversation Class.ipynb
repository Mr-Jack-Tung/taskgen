    "# Tutorial 6: Conversation Class\n",
    "\n",
    "- ConversableAgent: This class takes an Agent and allows for conversational-based interactions with User / another Agent / Environment. Also updates persistent memory with latest information in conversation\n",
    "    - Inputs:\n",
    "        - **agent (compulsory)**: Agent. The agent we want to interact with\n",
    "        - **persistent_memory**: dict. What kinds of memory the agent should have that persist over the entire conversation and their descriptions. Uses the same format as `output_format` of `strict_json`.\n",
    "        - **person**: str. The name of the person you are talking to\n",
    "        - **conversation**: List. The current existing conversation. Default: []\n",
    "        - **num_past_conversation**: int. The number of past conversations to use for the agent\n",
    "        - **verbose**: bool. Default: True. Whether to print the Agent's inner states\n",
    "        \n",
    "- ConversableAgent will automatically implement 3 new variables in `agent.shared_variables`:\n",
    "    - **Persistent Memory**: The memory that will be updated as the conversation goes along, defined in persistent_dict\n",
    "    - **Conversation**: The entire history of the conversationn\n",
    "    - **Summary of Conversation**: A summary of the current conversation\n",
    "    \n",
    "- ConversableAgent uses `chat()` which chats with the Agent and the Agent will perform actions and reply the chat message\n",
    "    \n",
    "- To use ConversableAgent, simply do the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
