This contains all the wrappers that gives additional functionalities to the base agent.

We are looking for:
- PlanningWrappers: How to plan and execute the plan, self-correct plan if there are any errors
- ReflectionWrappers: How to reflect upon what has been learned during task / across task and consolidate info for the next task
- ConversationWrappers: How to converse with the agent
- MultiAgentWrappers: How multiple agents can converse with one another

Any other Wrapper is fine. This helps to expand upon the characteristics of the Agent without changing the base code.
