    "# Tutorial 4 - Hierarchical Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functionalities:\n",
    "- An agent (referred as meta agent) can also assign other agents (referred as inner agents) as the function call, thereby creating a hierarchical structure\n",
    "- Whenever the inner agent is called, we will run the full inner agent's process until termination\n",
    "- Maximum number of steps for each agent (meta agent or inner agent) can be defined in `max_subtasks` (default: 5) variable when initialising agent\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Details:\n",
    "- The inner agent will take in meta agent's instruction as input\n",
    "- In addition, the inner agent will also have access to meta agent's task and subtasks completed for global context\n",
    "- Inner agent's output will directly go into meta agent's subtasks completed dictionary, enabling it to directly update global context\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Philosophy:\n",
    "- Bottom layers can get context of the top layers for more context-specific generation\n",
    "- Top layers choose bottom layers in a hierarchical fashion so as to limit the number of choices at each level for better performance\n",
    "- `subtasks_completed` serves as the global context for the meta agents and the inner agents, and can be summarised as needed, e.g. when performing a new task to filter out irrelevant information "
