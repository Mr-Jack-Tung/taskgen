    "# Tutorial 3 - Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Philosophy\n",
    "- It would be important to learn from past experience and improve the agentic framework - memory is key to that\n",
    "- You can add to the memory bank of your Agents pre-inference (by collecting from a pool of data prior to running the Agent), or during inference (add on in between running subtasks)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Note: Memory will likely be revamped in the future to support vector database insertion and retrieval, for faster runtime**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Memory in Agents\n",
    "- Agent class takes `memory_bank` as a parameter during initialisation of an `Agent`\n",
    "- memory_bank: class Dict[Memory]. Stores multiple types of memory for use by the agent. Customise the Memory config within the Memory class.\n",
    "    - Default: `memory_bank = {'Function': Memory(top_k = 5, mapper = lambda x: x.fn_description, approach = 'retrieve_by_ranker'), llm = self.llm}`\n",
    "    - Define `memory['Function'].retrieve_fn` in `memory_bank` if you would like to not use OpenAI API. This takes in the task and outputs a list of top k memory items\n",
    "    - Key: `Function` (Already Implemented Natively) - Does RAG over Task -> Function mapping\n",
    "    - Can add in more keys that would fit your use case. Retrieves similar items to task/overall plan (if able) for additional context in `get_next_subtasks()` and `use_llm()` function\n",
    "    - Side Note: RAG can also be done (and may be preferred) as a separate function of the Agent to retrieve more information when needed (so that we do not overload the Agent with information)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Memory Class\n",
    "- Retrieves top k memory items based on task \n",
    "- Inputs:\n",
    "    - `memory`: List. Default: Empty List. The list containing the memory items\n",
    "    - `top_k`: Int. Default: 3. The number of memory list items to retrieve\n",
    "    - `mapper`: Function. Maps the memory item to another form for comparison by ranker or LLM. Default: `lambda x: x`\n",
    "        - Example mapping: `lambda x: x.fn_description` (If x is a Class and the string you want to compare for similarity is the fn_description attribute of that class)\n",
    "    - `approach`: str. Either `retrieve_by_ranker` or `retrieve_by_llm` to retrieve memory items.\n",
    "        - Ranker is faster and cheaper as it compares via embeddings, but are inferior to LLM-based methods for contextual information\n",
    "    - `retrieve_fn`: Default: None. Takes in task and outputs top_k similar memories in a list\n",
    "    - `ranker`: `Ranker`. The Ranker which defines a similarity score between a query and a key. Default: OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` model. \n",
    "        - Can be replaced with a function which returns similarity score from 0 to 1 when given a query and key\n",
    "        \n",
    "## Example Use Case\n",
    "- Helps to reduce number of functions present in LLM context for more accurate generation\n",
    "```python\n",
    "output = my_agent.run('Calculate 2**10 * (5 + 1) / 10')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
