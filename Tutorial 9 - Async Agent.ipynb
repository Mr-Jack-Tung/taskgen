    "# Agent Basics\n",
    "- Create an agent by entering your agent's name and description\n",
    "- Agents are task-based, so they will help generate subtasks to fulfil your main task\n",
    "\n",
    "- Agents are made to be non-verbose, so they will just focus only on task instruction (Much more efficient compared to conversational-based agentic frameworks like AutoGen)\n",
    "- Agent's interactions will be stored into `subtasks_completed` by default, which will serve as a memory buffer for future interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inputs for Agent**:\n",
    "    - **agent_name**: String. Name of agent, hinting at what the agent does\n",
    "    - **agent_description**: String. Short description of what the agent does\n",
    "    - **max_subtasks**: Int. Default: 5. The maximum number of subtasks the agent can have\n",
    "    - **verbose**: Bool. Default: True. Whether to print out agent's intermediate thoughts\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent Internal Parameters**:\n",
    "    - **Task**: String. The task the agent has been assigned to - Defaults to \"No task assigned\"\n",
    "    - **Subtasks Completed**: Dict. The keys are the subtask names and the values are the result of the respective subtask\n",
    "    - **Is Task Completed**: Bool. Whether the current Task is completed\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automatic Task Running**\n",
    "    - **reset()**: Resets the Agent Internal Parameters\n",
    "    - **run(task: str)**: Performs the task. Do note that agent's state will not be reset, so if you want to reset it, call reset() prior to running this\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Manual Task Running**\n",
    "    - **assign(task: str)**: Assigns a task to the agent, setting Is Task Completed to False\n",
    "    - **run(num_subtasks: int)**: Runs the task for num_subtasks number of subtasks. Uses the existing assigned task\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Give User Output**\n",
    "    - **reply_user(query: str = '', stateful: bool = True)**: Using all information from subtasks, give a reply about the `query` to the user. If `query` is not given, then it replies based on the current task the agent is doing. If `stateful` is True, saves this query and reply into `subtasks_completed`\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",

    "#  Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Philosophy\n",
    "- It would be important to learn from past experience and improve the agentic framework - memory is key to that\n",
    "- You can add to the memory bank of your Agents pre-inference (by collecting from a pool of data prior to running the Agent), or during inference (add on in between running subtasks)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Memory in Agents\n",
    "- Agent class takes `memory_bank` as a parameter during initialisation of an `Agent`\n",
    "- memory_bank: class Dict[Memory]. Stores multiple types of memory for use by the agent. Customise the Memory config within the Memory class.\n",
    "    - Default: `memory_bank = {'Function': AsyncMemory(top_k = 5, mapper = lambda x: x.fn_description, approach = 'retrieve_by_ranker')}`\n",
    "\n",
    "## AsyncMemory Class\n",
    "- Retrieves top k memory items based on task \n",
    "- Inputs:\n",
    "    - `memory`: List. Default: Empty List. The list containing the memory items\n",
    "    - `top_k`: Int. Default: 3. The number of memory list items to retrieve\n",
    "    - `mapper`: Function. Maps the memory item to another form for comparison by ranker or LLM. Default: `lambda x: x`\n",
    "        - Example mapping: `lambda x: x.fn_description` (If x is a Class and the string you want to compare for similarity is the fn_description attribute of that class)\n",
    "    - `approach`: str. Either `retrieve_by_ranker` or `retrieve_by_llm` to retrieve memory items.\n",
    "        - Ranker is faster and cheaper as it compares via embeddings, but are inferior to LLM-based methods for contextual information\n",
    "    - `ranker`: `AsyncRanker`. The Ranker which defines a similarity score between a query and a key. Default: OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` model. \n",
    "        - Can be replaced with a async function which returns similarity score from 0 to 1 when given a query and key\n",
    "        \n",
    "## Example Use Case\n",
    "- Helps to reduce number of functions present in LLM context for more accurate generation\n",
