    "# 1. Agent Basics\n",
    "- Create an agent by entering your agent's name and description\n",
    "- Agents are task-based, so they will help generate subtasks to fulfil your main task\n",
    "\n",
    "- Agents are made to be non-verbose, so they will just focus only on task instruction (Much more efficient compared to conversational-based agentic frameworks like AutoGen)\n",
    "- Agent's interactions will be stored into `subtasks_completed` by default, which will serve as a memory buffer for future interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inputs for Agent**:\n",
    "    - **agent_name**: String. Name of agent, hinting at what the agent does\n",
    "    - **agent_description**: String. Short description of what the agent does\n",
    "    - **max_subtasks**: Int. Default: 5. The maximum number of subtasks the agent can have\n",
    "    - **verbose**: Bool. Default: True. Whether to print out agent's intermediate thoughts\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent Internal Parameters**:\n",
    "    - **Task**: String. The task the agent has been assigned to - Defaults to \"No task assigned\"\n",
    "    - **Subtasks Completed**: Dict. The keys are the subtask names and the values are the result of the respective subtask\n",
    "    - **Is Task Completed**: Bool. Whether the current Task is completed\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task Running**\n",
    "    - **reset()**: Resets the Agent Internal Parameters and Subtasks Completed. You should do this at the start of every new task assigned to the Agent to minimise potential confusion of what has been done for this task versus previous tasks\n",
    "    - **run(task: str, num_subtasks: int = max_subtasks)**: Performs the task. Do note that agent's state will not be reset, so if you want to reset it, call reset() prior to running this. Runs the task for **num_subtasks** steps. If not specified, we will take the **max_subtasks**.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Give User Output**\n",
    "    - **reply_user(query: str = '', stateful: bool = True)**: Using all information from subtasks, give a reply about the `query` to the user. If `query` is not given, then it replies based on the current task the agent is doing. If `stateful` is True, saves this query and reply into `subtasks_completed`\n",
